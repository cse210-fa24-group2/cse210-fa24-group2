# Automated Testing with Jest, Cypress, and Coverage Tools

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Automated testing is critical for ensuring the reliability and correctness of the codebase. Tools are required to handle both unit and end-to-end (E2E) tests efficiently.

## Decision
- **Jest**: Selected for JavaScript/TypeScript unit testing due to:
  - Built-in support for test coverage reporting.
  - Compatibility with modern JavaScript frameworks.

- **Cypress**: Chosen for E2E testing because:
  - It provides reliable browser testing and UI interaction capabilities.
  - Highly intuitive and developer-friendly syntax.

- **Coverage Reporting**: Integrated using Jest and Python's `coverage` package to measure and track test coverage for backend and frontend code.

## Consequences
- Improves code reliability with automated test coverage.
- Ensures both unit and E2E tests are part of the pipeline.
- Increases pipeline complexity and execution time.
