# Choosing Simple-DataTables vs. Building from Scratch or Using DataTables

## Context and Problem Statement  
For our project, we require a table library that provides features such as sorting, searching, and pagination. The decision is between adopting **Simple-DataTables**, building a solution from scratch, or using **DataTables**. Each option has unique benefits and trade-offs. Our primary constraints include **time**, **modern architecture without jQuery dependency**, and **ease of implementation** to meet project deadlines without compromising quality or maintainability.

## Decision Drivers  
- **Time Constraints**: Need for a quick and efficient implementation to align with project timelines.  
- **Dependency Management**: Avoid reliance on jQuery to ensure modern, lightweight architecture.  
- **Customizability**: Ability to modify and extend the solution easily if needed.  
- **Ease of Use**: Simplicity in integration and development to focus on core features.  
- **Performance**: A lightweight and fast solution suitable for our application.

## Considered Options  
1. **Simple-DataTables** – A lightweight, dependency-free library with core table features.  
2. **Build From Scratch** – Create a custom table library to meet specific requirements.  
3. **DataTables** – A feature-rich library that requires jQuery, providing advanced capabilities.

## Decision Outcome  
**Chosen option:** **Option 1 - Simple-DataTables**  
We selected Simple-DataTables because it aligns well with our requirements for a lightweight, modern, and dependency-free solution. It strikes a balance between simplicity, functionality, and quick implementation, which is crucial given our time constraints.

### Consequences  
- **Good:**  
  - No jQuery dependency, ensuring a modern and clean architecture.  
  - Quick and straightforward to integrate, saving development time.  
  - Lightweight and performs well for our use case.  
  - Sufficient functionality for sorting, filtering, and pagination without being overly complex.  

- **Bad:**  
  - Limited advanced features compared to DataTables, which may require future customization.  
  - Might require additional effort for highly specific customizations.  

## Pros and Cons of the Options  

### Option 1: Simple-DataTables (Chosen)  
- **Good:** Lightweight and fast, ensuring high performance.  
- **Good:** No external dependencies, aligning with a modern tech stack.  
- **Good:** Minimal learning curve, reducing implementation time.  
- **Bad:** Fewer advanced features out of the box compared to DataTables.  
- **Bad:** May require additional development for specialized needs.  

### Option 2: Build From Scratch  
- **Good:** Fully tailored to specific requirements.  
- **Good:** No external dependencies, complete control over architecture.  
- **Bad:** Significantly higher development time and cost.  
- **Bad:** Risk of bugs and maintenance burden due to lack of prior testing and community support.  

### Option 3: DataTables  
- **Good:** Extensive feature set for advanced table functionality.  
- **Good:** Strong community support and comprehensive documentation.  
- **Bad:** Requires jQuery, introducing an unwanted dependency.  
- **Bad:** Overly complex for our needs, leading to unnecessary bloat and reduced performance.

## Conclusion  
Choosing Simple-DataTables allows us to meet our immediate requirements while adhering to modern development standards. It provides the right balance of functionality, simplicity, and performance, enabling us to deliver the project efficiently without the overhead of unnecessary dependencies or excessive development time.
