# To-do List Feature Choices

## Status
Accepted

## Context
As described in our project pitch, our final dashboard will include a to-do list component to help organize the user's tasks. The web layout design of the to-do list will look similar to what is described in the project pitch. In this document, we cover how we decided what additional functionality to give the to-do list feature.

## Decision
We decided to give the to-do list a drag and drop functionality. How it works is:
- a user can drag and drop to-do list items within a column
- a user can drag and drop to-do list items between columns

We discussed this additional functionality amongst ourselves and consulted others and ultimately came to this decision because:
- it would make it easier to re-organize/re-prioritize tasks throughout the day
- if a task is not finished, it can be moved to a different column (i.e. from the 'today' column to the 'this week' column) or if a task becomes more urgent, it can be pushed forward to the 'today' column 


## Consequences
- Enables flexible prioritization of tasks
- More user friendly interface
- Increased development complexity: requires more testing and time to complete/integrate into website
