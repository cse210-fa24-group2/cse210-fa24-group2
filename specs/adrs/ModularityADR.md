# Modularity Design Decision for Dashboard Development

## Context
Modern software systems are vast and complex, often exceeding the capacity of individual developers to fully comprehend. Modular design is essential for managing this complexity by dividing systems into smaller, more manageable parts. It enables improved collaboration among teams, parallel development, and better overall system maintainability and scalability. (David Farley)

The core of modularity lies in decoupling code, establishing clear module boundaries, and ensuring changes in one module do not adversely affect others. Adopting modularity will help manage system complexity, enhance development efficiency, and reduce future maintenance costs. By dividing the project into self-contained modules, we aim to simplify development and testing, reduce interdependencies, and improve code reusability.

## Decision Drivers
1. **Complexity Management**: Modular design enables the division of systems into independent, easily understandable, and maintainable components, reducing the impact of complexity on development and testing.

2. **Test-Driven Development**: By making systems more modular, it ensures better testability, allowing individual modules to be tested independently, improving design quality while reducing overall testing costs.

3. **Parallel Development**: Modular design facilitates independent development of different modules, enhancing team collaboration and enabling faster iteration.

4. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Modular design enhances code flexibility, allowing for feature expansion or replacement without disrupting the overall architecture.

5. **Long-Term Maintainability**: Clear interfaces and well-separated module boundaries reduce risks and overhead associated with future system modifications.


## Decision Outcome
The project will be divided into the following modules:
1. **Frontend**: 
   - **Core UI**: Includes SPA structure, navigation.
   - **Feature Components**: Handles specific features: To-do list, calendar integration, and data table rendering.
2. **Backend**:
   - **API Services**: Responsible for Google Calendar integration and user authentication via OAuth.
   - **Task Management**: Manages To-do list operations (CRUD functionalities).
   - **Data Access Layer**: Interfaces with PostgreSQL for storing and retrieving data.
3. **Utilities**:
   - **Shared Utilities**: Includes common scripts for date formatting, data validation, and error handling.
   - **Testing Tools**: Automates unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend.
4. **Deployment and CI/CD**:
   - **Pipeline Jobs**: Covers setup, linting, testing, and deployment tasks.

## Consequences
### Positive
- **Improved Team Collaboration**: Clear module boundaries allow team members to work independently.
- **Simplified Debugging**: Issues are isolated to specific modules, reducing debugging time.
- **Efficient Feature Addition**: New features can be added to existing modules or as standalone modules with minimal disruption.

### Negative
- **Initial Overhead**: Requires more effort to define and set up module boundaries.
- **Potential for Duplication**: If communication between modules is not well-coordinated, redundant logic may occur.

## Related Decisions
- **Single Page Application Design**: The frontend SPA approach aligns well with modularity by organizing features into reusable components.
- **CI/CD Pipeline Modularity**: CI/CD setup mirrors the modular development approach, allowing independent testing and deployment of features.

## Implementation Plan
- Define module boundaries in the project directory structure (e.g., `frontend`, `backend`, `utils`, `ci-cd`).
- Implement API contracts to manage communication between frontend and backend modules.
- Use a shared codebase for utilities to minimize redundancy.
- Regularly review and refactor module interfaces to ensure consistency and efficiency.
