# Architecture Decision Record (ADR): Google Calendar Integration vs. Custom Calendar or Third-Party Calendar  

## Context and Problem Statement  

Our project requires a calendar system for event scheduling, reminders, and task management. We need to decide whether to integrate with **Google Calendar**, build a **custom calendar solution**, or use a **third-party calendar service**. The decision must balance user needs, development effort, scalability, and long-term maintainability.  

## Decision Drivers  

1. **User Familiarity**: Google Calendar is widely used, making it an intuitive choice for integration.  
2. **Development Complexity**: Building a custom solution requires significant time and resources.  
3. **Feature Set**: Google Calendar and third-party options provide robust out-of-the-box features, such as reminders, recurring events, and notifications.  
4. **Dependency Risks**: External services come with API limitations and dependency risks.  
5. **Resource Allocation**: Focus on core project features while leveraging existing calendar solutions.  

## Considered Options  

1. **Integrate Google Calendar via its API**  
2. **Build a Custom Calendar System**  
3. **Use a Third-Party Calendar Service**  

## Decision Outcome  

We chose **Option 1**: Integrate Google Calendar via its API.  

### Reasons:  
- **Seamless Integration with Google SSO**: Users authenticated via Google SSO can immediately connect their Google Calendar without additional sign-ins.  
- **User Familiarity**: Many users already use Google Calendar, reducing onboarding effort.  
- **Feature Richness**: Provides advanced features like bi-directional sync, timezone handling, and event notifications without additional development.  
- **Development Efficiency**: Reduces implementation time, allowing the team to focus on core features.  
- **Scalability**: Google Calendar offers reliable performance and handles a large user base.  

## Consequences  

### Positive Impacts:  
- **Quick Setup**: Saves development time compared to building a custom solution.  
- **Streamlined User Experience**: Google SSO and Google Calendar work seamlessly together.  
- **Enhanced User Adoption**: Familiar tools increase the likelihood of user engagement.  
- **Cost-Effective**: Eliminates recurring subscription costs associated with third-party services.  

### Negative Impacts:  
- **External Dependency**: Tied to Google APIâ€™s availability, policies, and rate limits.  
- **Authentication Overhead**: Requires implementing OAuth 2.0 alongside Google SSO integration.  

## Pros and Cons of Options  

### 1. **Integrate Google Calendar via its API**  
   - **Pros**:  
     - Pre-built robust features.  
     - Seamless integration with Google SSO.  
     - Reliable and scalable infrastructure.  
   - **Cons**:  
     - API rate limits and dependency on Google.  
     - Requires OAuth 2.0 implementation.  

### 2. **Build a Custom Calendar System**  
   - **Pros**:  
     - Full control over design and features.  
     - No dependency on third-party services.  
   - **Cons**:  
     - High development and maintenance cost.  
     - Time-consuming and resource-intensive.  
     - Difficult to match the feature richness of existing solutions.  

### 3. **Use a Third-Party Calendar Service**  
   - **Pros**:  
     - Quicker integration compared to custom builds.  
     - Provides pre-built UI components and functionalities.  
   - **Cons**:  
     - Subscription or licensing costs.  
     - Limited customization and feature control.  
     - API restrictions and potential data security concerns.

## Conclusion  

Integrating with **Google Calendar** provides a seamless and user-friendly experience, especially when paired with Google SSO. This integration minimizes development effort, ensures a robust feature set, and aligns with user expectations. Building a custom calendar or using a third-party service were deemed less favorable due to high resource demands and limited synergy with Google SSO.
