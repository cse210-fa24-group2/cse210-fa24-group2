# Choice of Tech Stack for Frontend and Backend Development

## Context and Problem Statement
In developing our dashboard for computer science students to manage their busy schedules, we needed to select appropriate technologies for both the frontend and backend. The decision revolved around whether to use basic web technologies or adopt frameworks and libraries that might introduce complexity beyond the scope of our project. We had to choose between:

- **Frontend**: Using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript versus employing frontend frameworks or libraries like React, Angular, Vue.js.
- **Backend**: Choosing between Flask and other Python web frameworks like Django of FastApi, as well as selecting the right database solutionâ€”PostgreSQL or alternatives like SQLite or Firebase.

Our task was to choose technologies that would support speedy development, ease interaction with the necessary APIs (Google Calendar and OAuth), and fit the scope of our project.

## Decision Drivers
- **Simplicity and Ease of Learning**: Choosing technology with which the group is familiar.
- **Development Speed**: Need to develop the project efficiently within a limited timeframe.
- **Project Scope**: Small-scale project that doesn't require complex architectures.
- **Integration Capabilities**: Necessity to integrate seamlessly with Google OAuth and Google Calendar APIs.
- **Avoiding Unnecessary Complexity**: Minimizing dependencies and avoiding over-engineering.

## Considered Options

### Frontend Options
1. **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: Building the frontend using standard web technologies without additional frameworks or libraries.
2. **Frontend Frameworks/Libraries**: Utilizing React, Angular, or Vue.js to build a more dynamic frontend.

### Backend Framework Options
1. **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework that is easy to learn and flexible.
2. **Django**: A more extensive Python web framework with built-in features and conventions.

### Database Options
1. **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database.
2. **SQLite**: A lightweight, file-based relational database.
3. **Firebase**: A cloud-based NoSQL database.

### Deployment Options
1. **Render**: A cloud platform for hosting web applications and services.
2. **Heroku**: A platform-as-a-service (PaaS) for deploying web applications.
3. **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: A comprehensive cloud platform offering a wide range of services.
4. **Self-Hosting**: Deploying the application on our own servers or infrastructure.

## Decision Outcome
**Chosen Options**:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (No Frameworks)
