# Choice of Tools for Linting and Static Analysis

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Linting and static analysis tools are essential for maintaining code quality, enforcing standards, and detecting potential issues early in the development process.

## Decision
- **Python Linting**: Selected `black`, `flake8`, and `pylint` for:
  - Ensuring consistent formatting (`black`).
  - Highlighting PEP-8 compliance (`flake8`).
  - Identifying logical and structural issues (`pylint`).

- **JavaScript Static Analysis**: Selected `eslint` with plugins:
  - `eslint-plugin-security` for security vulnerability detection.
  - `eslint-plugin-jsdoc` for enforcing documentation standards.

## Consequences
- Enforces consistent and clean code style across the project.
- Identifies potential security and quality issues during development.
- Increases pipeline execution time due to multiple tools.
