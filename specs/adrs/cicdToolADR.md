# Choice of GitHub Actions as CI/CD Tool

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project requires a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate code quality checks, testing, documentation generation, and deployment.

GitHub Actions is a widely used, built-in tool for CI/CD workflows that integrates seamlessly with GitHub repositories. It supports various actions, reusable workflows, and community-contributed extensions.

## Decision
We selected GitHub Actions as the CI/CD tool for this project due to:
- Its native integration with GitHub, eliminating the need for third-party tools.
- Support for YAML-based workflows, allowing clear and modular configurations.
- Extensive ecosystem of actions for various programming languages, tools, and tasks.

## Consequences
- Enables efficient workflow creation and collaboration.
- Reduces overhead by avoiding external CI/CD tools.
- Provides visibility and accessibility of workflows directly within GitHub.
