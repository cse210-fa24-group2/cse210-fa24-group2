# Separation of Jobs for Modular Pipeline

## Status
Accepted

## Context
A modular pipeline ensures clarity, scalability, and debuggability. Each stage (e.g., linting, testing, deployment) should operate independently to maintain workflow reliability.

## Decision
We created separate jobs for setup, linting, testing, documentation, static analysis, and deployment:
- **Setup**: Prepares the environment with dependencies and configuration.
- **Linting and Code Quality**: Ensures code style and best practices.
- **Testing**: Executes unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- **Documentation**: Automates API documentation generation.
- **Deployment**: Automates the release process.
- **Static Analysis**: Identifies security vulnerabilities and code quality issues.

## Consequences
- Improved pipeline readability and maintainability.
- Facilitates independent execution and debugging of jobs.
- Increases pipeline execution time due to parallel job overhead.
