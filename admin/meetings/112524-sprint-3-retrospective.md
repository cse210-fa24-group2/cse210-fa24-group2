## Strengths

* So far, everyone has accurately predicted how much work they can do for each sprint. Everyone is completing their work in a timely manner and delivering what they said they will, or communicating openly if they are unable to deliver 100% of what was expected.

## Areas to Improve

* Disconnect between backend and frontend  
  * Up until now, we’ve been developing the frontend and backend separately. We did this due to ease and scheduling issues, but we realize that this likely isn’t the most effective or efficient way to create our app.  
  * To solve this disconnect, we will be pairing each frontend member/feature with a backend member to improve the process of integrating the features with the backend.  
* Github master at conference which shed light on our lack of understanding of the CICD pipeline  
  * We have tried to ensure that each member’s work can be picked up by another member if needed, but with our GitHub member being at a conference last week, we realized that we will need to put more effort into understanding the CICD pipeline  
  * This week, we will meet with our GitHub Master to get an overview of the CICD pipeline  
* Project board use  
  * Although we’ve set up our GitHub project board, most team members are not using it. Instead, the members look at our sprint plans and update members on progress using our WhatsApp group.  
  * To make our progress easier to understand for TA/grader, team members will make more of an effort to update progress on project board.
