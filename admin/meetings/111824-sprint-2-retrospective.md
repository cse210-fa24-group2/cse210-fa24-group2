## Strengths

* Received good feedback on the CICD pipeline

## Areas to Improve

* We need to understand how we’re going to add all of these components together – we’ll set aside a sprint just to make sure each piece is fitting together  
* Some team members are confused about CICD pipeline, Ishan can advise   
* We’ll scope down to just have a dashboard view given time constraints  
* In our last planning session, we planned to do way too much – we’ll focus more on incrementally making progress
