# Planning

The goal for this sprint is to integrate all the components onto one dashboard and integrate with the backend. Please update the project board as you work and follow our GitHub best practices doc. This is our most intensive sprint, so if minor items roll over to the next sprint, thatâ€™s okay\! Our goal is to have our first version complete by next Wednesday.
