## Strengths

Overall the team feels confident and happy with where we’re at. Here are some details:

* Pairing backend and frontend members has worked extremely well – frontend members are feeling more confident with their changes and integrating the backend with the frontend wasn’t quite as difficult as anticipated  
* We’re beginning to see what the components look like when integrated into the dashboard, and it’s exciting to see our final product come together  
* The light and dark mode has improved the look and feel of the site to something everyone is happy with  
* Postgres is working well, which was a relief  
* The todo list is nearly completed in its entirety, and it looks great

## Areas to Improve

* We significantly overestimated what we could accomplish for the week of Thanksgiving, and since those tasks rolled over, we’re having a bit of a crunch time moment. Although we all feel confident, we also wish we had the frontend and backend integrated and the dashboard streamlined by now. We’ll just need to work a bit harder this coming week.  
* We realized the frontend doesn’t have any unit testing, which we’re adding this week.
