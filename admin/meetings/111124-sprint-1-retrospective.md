# Retrospective

## Attendance

* Present  
  * Ishan   
  * Maitree  
  * Shelby  
  * Sarah  
  * Bruce  
  * Ronit   
  * Siddhant

## Strengths

* We feel we’ve put adequate time into set up/architectural decisions and we’re ready to begin code

## Areas to Improve

* Today’s meeting is too long with review, retrospective, and planning session  
  * Moving forward, we will have a 30 min review meeting on Sundays (via Zoom for easy demos), and our Monday meeting will be for the retrospective and planning session  
* We could have spent more time setting up our code this week – we’ll have to clearly define set up tasks in the future
